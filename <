{% include JB/setup %}


The aim of this module was to be able to:

- enable the access to the Performance Monitor Unit (cf. <a
  href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0388i/BEHEDIHI.html"
  target="_blank">PMU</a>) control registers in user-mode
- read the Cycle Counter register
- trigger the cache flush operation from the external world (outside the kernel world)

According to ARM's documentation: "The system control coprocessor, CP15, controls [...] cache
configuration and management." (cf. <a
href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0388f/CIHGCFGG.html"
target="_blank"> About system control</a>)

If we check the <a
href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0388f/CIHGCFGG.html"
target="_blank"> Registers summary</a> one can notice that we can access to the CP15 system control
registers using the instructions "MCR" and "MRC". From the same page, one can notice that one of the
main functionalities of the CP15 is to proveide "<a

Registers</a>".
